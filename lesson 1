A computer can't think on it's own, it can't understand any context whatsover, and it can only follow the instructions that you give to the teeth

think of variables as drawers that can only store on kind of thing, to make a new variable you have to declare it,
give it a name, and assign a value to it.

You can think of it as opening a new drawer, puting the value inside of it and then taking the variable name as a unique label that you stick to the drawer, so that the computer can easily locate  and find it, and as a refrence so a computer knows what you are talking about
