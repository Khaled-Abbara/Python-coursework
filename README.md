# Python-lessons
This is a Repo that contains all the python lessons that I have made for my students to teach them programing

In this I included Explanations, examples and, questions

I will be also making use of teaching different Ai tools during my lessons so students can have an even greater advantage if they are to become future programmers.

Please feel free to fork this or even contribute to it!
