# We use the "#" symbol to comment in python, 
# commenting is useful because we can use it as a way to explain things or to have any notes related to the code.

# Assign the value 1 to the variable numOne
numOne = 1

# Assign the value 3 to the variable numTwo
numTwo = 3

# Add the values of numOne and numTwo (1 + 3) and store the result in the variable result
result = numOne + numTwo

# Print the value of result (which is 4) to the console
print(result)
